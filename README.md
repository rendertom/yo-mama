## Demo

Android users can run the app on the phone from [expo.io](https://expo.io/@rendertom/projects/yo-mama). Just follow the instructions on the website to get started. Alternatively, download the `yo-mama-<...>-android.apk` file from the [releases](https://github.com/rendertom/yo-mama/releases) section and install it on your phone manually.

For iOS users - currently, there's no way to run the app on a physical phone. There is, however, a way to run the app on your Mac in Simulator app. To do so, download `yo-mama-<...>-iOS-simulator.tar.gz` file from the [releases](https://github.com/rendertom/yo-mama/releases) section and install it on the Simulator app (you'll need Xcode application for that). Alternatively, you can build and run the project locally and serve it with the expo client.

## Build/develop locally

Download the repository and do the following:

```bash
# install Watchman (macOS only)
brew update
brew install watchman

# navigate to the project folder
cd path/to/yo-mama

# start expo server
npx expo start
```

- To run the iOS simulator, you'll need [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
- To run the android emulator, you'll need [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
